                <p class="m-p">Mercy is a coyote shifter who was raised werewolf. She's also a great VW mechanic. Mercy doesn't shy away from helping someone or doing the right thing – even when it puts her life on the line. Some of her closest friends and family members are powerful werewolves, fae, and vampires. She is able to shift into a coyote because her father was a skin that Coyote wore for awhile. Baking is her favorite thing to do when she's upset, and if that doesn't help, she works on cars. A fae walking stick follows her around because it likes her, and she has a cat that loves all things supernatural – no werewolf, vampire, or fae can stop her cat from cozying on up to them. Mercy loves Adam Hauptman, is married to him, and often surprises when when she takes care of him.</p>

                <p class="m-p">Adam Hauptman was Mercy's next door neighbor until they got married. He's the alpha of the Columbia Basin Pack and he was changed into a werewolf during the Vietnam War. He has a daughter, Jesse, and an ex-wife, Christy. Adam spent years trying to slowly woo Mercy, who did her best to annoy him (case in point: the dilapidated car Mercy kept by her trailer where only he could see it – he hates clutter). Adam is toughm but kind, and he believes that everyone should have the chance to prove themselves. His pack is changing werewolf and supernatural boundaries across the world by allowing women to rank in dominance, allowing non-werewolves in the pack (excluding human mates – they have always been allowed), and negotiating a safe territory for all supernatural creatures and humans alike.</p>

                </div>
                <p class="m-p">Samuel Cornick is the son of the Marrok – the ruler of all werewolves in North America. He's nearly as old as his father who is over 1300 years old (the exact date is unknown). Samuel is a doctor who loves children. He courted Mercy when she was a teenager in hopes of marrying her and having children. Werewolf females cannot carry a child to term, and Samuel has lost a lot of wives and children throughout the years. He cares about Mercy, but his father sent her away when she was 16. He came into the Tri-Cities Area as a lone wolf (with Adam's permission) and tried to court Mercy again, but he and Mercy realized that they see each other as pack mates, not "mate mates." Samuel was lonely after that and attempted suicide but he found the will to live after running an old fae love, Ariana, who he never thought he'd see again. The two of them are very happy in the Tri-Cities Area and they help Mercy and Adam when the supernatural events get crazy.</p>
