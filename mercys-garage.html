                <h3 class="garage-titles">Sieboldt Adelbertsmiter</h3>
                <p class="garage-p">Zee is the cranky, cantankerous old fae who Mercy worked for before he sold her his garage. He calls himself a gremlin, which means that he can work with metal, but he is much scarier than his glamour as an old, pot-bellied man would have you believe. He used to create dangerous blades filled with magic that could cut through nearly anything with one slice. He was forced to find a human woman to reproduce with, but he ended with falling in love with her and having a son. His wife died of cancer, and he blamed the fae for making him feel vulnerable through love. When he’s not helping Mercy with her garage or supernatural problems, he’s on the hunt for dangerous fae artifacts that he can destroy.</p>

            <div class="fifth">
                <h3 class="garage-titles">Thaddeus Adelbertsmiter</h3>
                <p class="garage-p">Tad is Zee’s son. He’s half-human, which is supposed to mean that he’s pretty much harmless. But his secret is that he's actually very powerful for a halfing fae, and he and his father are trying to hide this information from the Fae. He hired Mercy to work in his dad’s garage after his mother died and his father shut down for awhile. He was nine or ten at the time. He was Mercy’s assistant until he graduated from high school and went to college. He’s now in his early twenties, has landed back at home, works for Mercy again, and is great backup in a battle.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="fifth">
                <h3 class="garage-titles">Gabriel Sandoval</h3>
                <p class="garage-p">Gabriel is a young human man who works for Mercy between college semesters. He began working for her in high school, in exchange for her fixing his mother’s car. He is very protective and very loyal. His mother kicked him out of her home after he sided with his supernatural friends and he moved into Mercy’s old trailer. He’s dating Jesse and is currently attending college.  </p>
            </div>
            <div class="fifth">
                <h3 class="garage-titles">Stefan Uccello</h3>
                <p class="garage-p">Stefan is a vampire who is also Mercy’s friend. He dresses like Shaggy from Scooby Doo and even has a Mystery Machine themed VW van that he works on in Mercy’s Garage. Stefan is one of the few vampires who does not have to listen to their Maker and is able to transport anywhere at will. He was tortured and released from Marsilia’s seethe in a political maneuver that nearly killed him. Mercy is bound to him, but he does his best to leave their bond alone and refuses to rejoin the seethe for that reason; he loves Mercy and would never do anything to harm her or their friendship. He's one of the few vampires that's able to hold onto his sheep without killing them.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="fifth">
                <h3 class="garage-titles">Tony Montenegro</h3>
                <p class="garage-p">Tony is a human undercover cop whose Italian and Venezuelan genetics have given him very fluid features and a skin tone that can pass as anything from Mexican to African American. Mercy can smell through his disguises and bewildered him when she saw through them. They’ve become good friends and he often stops by her garage to test her with his disguises or to ask for advice on supernatural matters affecting police work. He’s sweet on Gabriel’s mother and sent her to Mercy to get her car fixed.</p>
