            </div>
            <div class="float-left">
            <span><h3 class="pack-left">Jesse Hauptman</h3></span>
                <div class="info-lft">Jesse is Adam’s human daughter. She used to live with her mother, but after telling her father about her mother’s neglectful ways, she’s permanently with her father. She’s a sassy 17-years-old, and in true teenage fashion, her hair color changes every few weeks. She’s grown up with the werewolves and she understands them much better than the average human. Her father is a very public figure and at times she takes flack for it from her schoolmates, but she does her best to ignore it. She’s currently dating Gabriel Sandoval while he’s off in college.
                </div>
            <span><h3 class="pack-left">Darryl & Auriele Zao</h3></span>
                <div class="info-lft">Darryl is the pack’s second and he’s mated to the werewolf Auriele. Darryl is a mix of Chinese and African, has a Ph.D. in engineering and is a very big man. He’s an amazing cook and carries the air of a respected college professor. Auriele is a small Hispanic woman mated to Darryl and a high school chemistry teacher. She isn’t happy about having a coyote shifter as her alpha’s mate, but she likes Mercy despite herself. She is a good friend of Christy, Jesse’s mother and Adam’s ex-wife. Auriele and Darryl make an impressive fighting team.
                </div>
                <span><h3 class="pack-left">Honey Jorgenson & Peter Jorgenson</h3></span>
                <div class="info-lft">Honey is one of the three female werewolves in the pack. She looks like a gorgeous trophy wife but is as dominant as wolves come and a mean fighter.  Honey initially doesn’t like that Mercy brings change to the pack, but grows to appreciate it. She was mated to the submissive werewolf Peter Jorgenson, who was recently murdered in front of the pack. Peter was the pack’s submissive wolf – which meant he wasn’t driven by a need to dominate – and they loved and cherished him. He was a cavalry officer in the American Revolution before he was changed into a werewolf, and he used those skills to teach Jesse how to fight with a sword. Peter was murdered by a renegade government agent who helped kidnap the pack and made the mistake of shooting Peter to prove his power over the pack. Honey tore the agent to shreds as soon as she was freed. A fading ghost of Peter still hangs around Honey – though only Mercy can see him.
                </div>
                 <span><h3 class="pack-left">Mary Jo</h3></span>
                <div class="info-lft">Mary Jo is a woman firefighter and one of the three female werewolves in the pack. She was killed by a fellow pack member after vampires used a magical item to make the werewolves go berserk. Baba Yaga brought her back to life as a favor to Mercy. After that, Mary Jo – along with a few other members of the pack – subtly used pack bonds to influence Mercy’s actions and thoughts in an attempt to sabotage Mercy’s relationship with Adam. She made reparations, but still loathes Mercy and believes that Adam deserves a better mate than a lowly coyote. She is a good friend of Christy, Jesse’s mother and Adam’s ex-wife.
                </div>
                <span><h3 class="pack-left">Zack Drummond</h3></span>
                <div class="info-lft">Zack is a submissive werewolf who joined the pack not long after Peter Jorgenson’s death. He gets restless easily and tends to drift between packs. However, he appears to enjoy the Columbia Basin Pack, and it doesn’t seem like he’ll be leaving anytime soon. Zack currently lives with Kyle and Warren.
                </div>
                 <span><h3 class="pack-left">Joel Arocha & Lucia Arocha</h3></span>
                <div class="info-lft">Joel was a normal human guy who worked security jobs in the winter and worked the rest of the year in the vineyards. He and his wife bred dogs and trained them, and also rehabilitated aggressive dogs brought to the animal shelters. He was turned into a tibicena – a fierce fire dog – by an ancient volcano god and it upturned his life. Mercy tied him to the pack and now he runs with the werewolves instead of being enslaved by the crazy volcano god. Lucia is Joel’s wife and she’s a fierce woman who loves dogs as much as Joel. She and Joel are currently living with Mercy and Adam after Joel’s transformation upended their lives.

            <div class="float-right">
                <span><h3 class="pack-right">Warren Smith & Kyle Brooks</h3></span>
                <div class="info-rgt">Warren is the pack’s third and he’s mated to a human lawyer, Kyle Brooks. Warren was a real cowboy in the West when he was changed into a werewolf; he is over 170 years old. He was a lone wolf for most of that time because it’s very difficult to survive as a gay werewolf. He was working at a gas station when Mercy met and befriended him; eventually she introduced him to Adam who inducted him into the pack. He’s worked as a bodyguard for Kyle’s clients and is currently doing private detective work. Kyle Brooks is a human who works as a divorce attorney and is mated to werewolf Warren Smith. He’s sharp, has a business reputation as a shark, and wields his physical beauty as a useful tool.
                </div>
            <span><h3 class="pack-right">Ben Shaw</h3></span>
                <div class="info-rgt">Ben is the pack’s werewolf import from London. He’s foul-mouthed and a bit of a misogynist, but he’s also very loyal to Adam, Mercy, and the pack; and he works as a database administrator for a government contractor. He also went out of his way to save a woman at his workplace from a sexual predator, so those close to him consider his stance on women as slowly evolving.
                </div>
            <span><h3 class="pack-right">Paul</h3></span>
                <div class="info-rgt">Paul is one of the werewolves who helped Mary Jo use pack ponds to influence Mercy’s actions and thoughts. He doesn’t like change, and he is one of the pack members opposed to Warren for being gay. He is also against Mercy as Adam’s mate because she’s a coyote. He has attempted to challenge both Warren and Adam in dominance fights and failed to win either.
                </div>
            <span><h3 class="pack-right">Sherwood Post</h3></span>
                <div class="info-rgt">Sherwood Post is a werewolf who made up his name on the spot because he can’t remember anything about his past. He had been a captive of a witch in Seattle for a very long time, and lost one of his legs in the process. He stayed with the Marrok for awhile before coming to the Columbia Basin Pack. He intended to kill himself, but couldn’t bring himself to do it and is finding more purpose and stimulation in his new pack than he expected.
                </div>
                 <span><h3 class="pack-right">Aiden</h3></span>
                <div class="info-rgt">Aiden is a human boy who got stuck in Underhill for centuries. Underhill is essentially a living, breathing dimension that many of the Fae used to live in before she shut her doors to them. She gave powers to the leftover human children who were stuck, and Aiden was given the power of fire (he's known as "The Fire Touched"). He wandered out of Underhill quite recently and after a bad experience with the Fae, he’s living with Adam and Mercy and the pack. He many be centuries old, but he still looks like a ten-year-old, and he’s working hard to adapt to life (especially socialization) in the modern world.
